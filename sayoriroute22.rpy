    "I wake up, groggy as I’ve ever been."
    "Despite this, I still feel good. Proud, in fact."
    "I had a very good time with Sayori yesterday, and we even got some homework done."
    "I remember our little game, at which point I lift my head up off my pillow and look at the floor."
    "There, I see our game of Battleship, still scattered across the floor."
    "I should clean that up soon."
    "But, not right now. Right now, all I ought to do is appreciate my surroundings."
    "Specifically, I should appreciate the ball of sunshine huddled into my shoulder, with her arms wrapped around mine like it’s a teddy bear."
    "I feel so warm inside seeing her so comfortable. And I’m the reason for that."
    "If that doesn’t make a person feel good, I don’t know what would."
    "I observe Sayori and appreciate the light she’s radiating."
    "There’s so much purity coming from her. It’s enough to intoxicate someone."
    "I smile at my girlfriend, who’s still lying there lightly snoring."
